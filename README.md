# 🌱  – My Java Learning Project

Hi! I'm learning Java,
---

## 📘 Why I Made This

I'm a beginner in Java, and I wanted a place to:

- Write and run my own Java code
- Learn how Java projects are structured
- Try out new things as I learn them
- Track my progress and build confidence

---

## 🛠️ What I’m Using

- **Java JDK** – to write and run Java programs  
- **Maven** – to manage the project and build it easily  
- **IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse** – my code editor  
- **Google & YouTube** – my best friends when I get stuck 😄

## 🚀 How to Run My Project

If you want to try it too:

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/myusername/MR.git

# Go into the folder
cd MR

# Build and run (if using Maven)
mvn clean install
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.mr.Main"
